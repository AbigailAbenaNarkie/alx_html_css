# Headphones Landing Page

This project is a fully responsive landing page for a headphones brand, built entirely with HTML and CSS based on a provided Figma design. It follows accessibility best practices and adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to replicate the given Figma mockup **pixel-perfectly** without using any external libraries or JavaScript.  
The page showcases a modern hero section, features, statistics, a contact form, and a footer — all styled to match the design exactly.

- **Mobile-first** approach — layout changes at 480px screen width.
- Uses semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility.
- Hover and active states for links and buttons:
  - **Links**: `#FF6565` color change.
  - **Buttons**: `opacity: 0.9` on hover/active.
- Content width capped at **1000px** and centered.
- Typography:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - Spin Cycle OT

## 🛠 Technologies Used
